## What did(not) we like in the group?

As a group we worked well, setting our deadlines and priorities. We followed the User Stories done at the beginning, although very often we wanted to expand them by inserting new features. It was interesting to work in a team especially to be able to compare and to combine different skills of the components of the group. However there was some communication problem. This came from a lack of experience on different IT sector and a different view about the quality.
